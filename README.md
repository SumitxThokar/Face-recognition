## Face Recognition Assignment
This repository contains my implementation for the face recognition assignment from Coursera. In this assignment, I have accomplished the following tasks:
- Implemented one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem.
- Applied the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition.
- Posed face recognition as a binary classification problem.
- Utilized a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings.
- Performed face verification and face recognition using these encodings.

The purpose of this assignment was to gain practical experience in face recognition techniques and understand the underlying concepts. By completing this assignment, I have enhanced my skills in implementing one-shot learning, triplet loss, and working with pretrained models for face recognition.

Note: This assignment was completed as part of the Coursera course, and the code may not be applicable for real-world scenarios without proper adaptations and considerations.
